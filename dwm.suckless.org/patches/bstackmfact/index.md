bmstackmfact
============

Description
-----------
Updates and combines the [bottomstack patch](../patches/bottomstack/) and the 
[stackmfact patch](../patches/stackmfact). Invoking the `setsmfact` function
(default binding shift-mod-[h,l]) with the bottomstack
layout changes the width of the first client in the
stack and distrubutes the remaining screen width equally among the
remaining clients. The effect of `setmfact` on the tiling layout
remains as in the original stackmfact patch.
