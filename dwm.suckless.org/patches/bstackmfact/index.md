bmstackmfact
============

Description
-----------
Updates and combines the [bottomstack patch](../bottomstack/) and the
[stackmfact patch](../stackmfact). Invoking the `setsmfact` function
(default binding: Shift+Mod+[h,l]) while using the bottomstack layout changes
the width of the first client in the stack and distrubutes the remaining
screen width equally among the other clients. The effect of `setmfact`
on the tiling layout remains as in the same as in the original stackmfact patch.
