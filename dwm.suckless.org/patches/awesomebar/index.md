awesomebar
=====================

Description
-----------
This patch changes the taskbar to be more like awesome. To be specific, it:
* shows all tasks in the current tag in the taskbar at all times
* clicking on an unfocused window's title in the taskbar focuses that window
* clicking on a focused window's title in the taskbar hides that window
* clicking on a hidden window's title in the taskbar unhides and focuses that window

You can also hide and unhide windows from the keyboard. The default bindings are:
* M-j/M-k to cycle through the visible windows in the current workspace
* M-J/M-K to cycle through all windows in the current workspace - hidden windows shown this way are re-hidden once focus is lost
* M-h to hide the current active window
* M-s to unhide a window made visible by M-J/M-K
* M-S to show all windows in the current workspace including hidden windows
  
Since this patch relies on knowing how big everything is in the taskbar, make sure to adjust the buttonpress()/drawbar() functions to account for any space in the taskbar used by other patches (such as systray).
