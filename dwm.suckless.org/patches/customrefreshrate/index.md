# customrefreshrate

## Description

This simple patch aims to make window dragging & resizing smoother by allowing the user to sync dwm's internal refresh rate with the refresh rate of their monitor.

To set a custom refresh rate, edit the *refreshrate* variable in config.h. The default is 60 frames per second.
