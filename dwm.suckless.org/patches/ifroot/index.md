ifroot
======

Description
-----------
Adds the `ifroot` function, which allows assigning two actions to a single keybinding.
The first action is executed when no client is focused, and the second when a client
is focused. This is mainly intended for using the same keybinding to close windows,
quit dwm, or open the power menu.
