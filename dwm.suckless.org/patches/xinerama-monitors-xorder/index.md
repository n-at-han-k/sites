xinerama monitors xorder
========================

Description
-----------
Sorts Xinerama monitors by their `x_org` value (horizontal position),
ensuring directional monitor movement (e.g. `Mod+Shift+Left/Right`) reflects
physical screen layout from left to right.

This is helpful in multi-monitor setups where the logical screen order from
Xinerama doesn't match the physical layout.
