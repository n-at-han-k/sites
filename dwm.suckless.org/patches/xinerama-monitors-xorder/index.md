xinerama monitors xorder
========================

Description
-----------
Orders Xinerama monitors based on their `x_org` coordinate (horizontal position),
so that directional commands like `Mod+Shift+Left/Right` move between monitors in
the same order as their physical placement from left to right.

This improves usability in multi-monitor configurations where Xinerama’s logical
screen sequence doesn’t align with the real-world layout.
