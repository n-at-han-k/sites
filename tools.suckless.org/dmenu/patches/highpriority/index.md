highpriority
============

Description
-----------
This patch will automatically sort the search result so that high priority items are shown first.

Adds the option *[SchemeHp]* to *colors* in config.def.h and the flags *hb*, *hf*, and *hp*.

* *hb*: Background color of the high priority items
* *hf*: Foreground color of the high priority items
* *hp*: A CSV (comma-seperated list) of high priority items

In this case, *chromium* is added to *hp* and it came first on search instead of *chromedriver*
